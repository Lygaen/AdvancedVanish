# Advanced Vanish
A Good Plugin for /vanish...

## Description
It's a plugin that allow you to use the /vanish command at different ranks.

## System
The plugin allows you to hide yourself, but at different ranks, going from 9 to 0. If you have vanished with a power of 6, all players that
don't have a perm of 6 or lower can't see you. If you hide with a perm of 0, only players with a perm of 0 can see you.<br>
If you don't give any rank in the command, the plugin will check the lowest power you have and give it as your rank : if you have the perms
for a 0 power vanish, the plugin will vanish you with a power of 0. The vanishlist is here to show you all players that are vanish and you
have the power to see.
